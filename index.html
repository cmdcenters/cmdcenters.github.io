<h2>Existentialism concerning modern post capitalist society</h2>
8/15/22
<hr>
<p> 
I think that it is pretty clear at this point in society that everything that we interact with or feel or even touch is to a certain degree tainted by the falsehood of modern culture and post capitalist society. There are no unique interests or unique thoughts anymore because everything is proliferated on the internet in various corners of it. There is absolutely nothing that is untouched by this disease that is post capitalist consumerism. Even the most sacred things to human nature like language, love, and sex are tainted. Language is an obvious one, everyone since the creation of the internet has gotten less and less distinct and unique. Coloquial phrases are being shared like memes, passed around from town to town, city to city, country to country. There is no uniqueness in how young people speak, that is of course, unless you are okay with not 'fitting in'. Fitting in seemingly is the most important thing to any one who is anyone these days. We are all subject to this as young people. On a moral level I am extremely against buying things from companies with unethical labor practices, specifically when it comes to children, yet I still sit in raffles for the latest Nike Shoes, hoping that I can maybe get a chance at fitting in, or maybe even stand out. What even is standing out. People who want to stand out all act the same way. For guys if you want to stand out you start listening to tame impala, or maybe King Gizzard, you start wearing linnen button down shirts with wife beaters underneath and gold jewelry. Maybe you will get your ears pierced, thats what I did. If you are a girl maybe you start reaserching astrology, do tarot card readings, maybe buy a PC and start playing video games. All of these things that are "out of the ordinary" and make someone "stand out" are nothing but different personas that the market has decided are okay for consumption. You can show vague interest in things that would previously be considered "nerdy". For example if an attractive girl like pokemon its cute, she has her pikachu plushie that she bought for 35 dollars on Amazon, (pennies of which actually go to the people who made the plushie) and people flock because it is so unusual for a girl to have mild knowledge about something previously considered nerdy. Same goes for guys, if you like music that people wouldnt normally associate you with that is cool! Oh my gosh you listen to Mitski!??? Or if a guy is a little bit nerdy about video games thats okay. God forbid that anyone actually takes a deep interest and knowledge into something. If you are super into an instrument you are a band kid. If you like computers and are fascinated by the internal mechanisms and processes that make modern computer technology work you are a geek, or a filthy basement dwelling incel. If you take too much interest in fashion you are gay, if you love school and learning you are weird. The list goes on and on, and on. If you become too obsessive that becomes weird. I mean even for things that are traditionally considered cool. Say you love basketball, all your life you have watched film of the best, and you are motivated to become the next greatest player, you want to make it out for your family, for your city, for everything around you. What do you do in this situation, you commit yourself to becoming the best, you stop going to hang out with friends, you focus on yourself and your game because you are committed. You would think that people would be supportive of this sort of action, the commitment to an activity for the betterment of the self, yet people will look at you with scorn telling you that you can never do it. Just be normal, just give in, have indifference about everything that you do. Who cares that you will live a life of regret knowing that if you worked harder maybe you could have given your family a better life. Indifference is comfort for a post capitalist society.

Clearly there is an existensial problem of complete indifference in society today due to the corruption of society through modern culture. The internet, tik tok, everything has tainted our lives forever. We are constantly being pumped with ideas that are not our own, thoughts created by some think tank in DC if you want to get conspiratorial. I mean they even had me thinking that if I voted for Biden over Trump I would make a difference in the world. The Earth is still burning and I most likely will never get to see my kids grow up due to the impending doom that our planet is in. Its no suprise that suicide rates are up 30% since 2000. Modern Culture fucking sucks. Your brain being turned to mush everyday due to the amount of dopamine that it is being flooded with by social media, video games, youtube, television. Humans were not and are not made to be in constant communication with eachother. There is almost no time for internal monologue and refleciton. So what do you do? Do you continue thinking about the downward trend of the world like I do and contemplate killing yourself before you turn 60? The easy option is to just give in. Just let society wash over you like a crashing wave and give in to modern society. I often think of the modern Blade Runner when thinking about things like this. Do you give in like K at the beginning of the movie? Do you do your job unquestioningly, doing whatever your boss tells you, then go home and eat your processed garbage that they tell you is dinner and jack off your limp dick to your hologram girlfriend? I mean if you dont think about it its not that bad, you can just float through life, never really have to feel any pain and die by 80 with two kids, a wife that you hate and being trapped in middle management your whole life not having achieved anything of worth, and then die a second time just a few years later when you cross someones mind for the last time, wrapping up your exsistence to be completely insignificant? Its tempting. The other option is not much better. Sure you live a life that is actually meaningful, you stand up, you don't get put down over and over again by people telling you to just conform, or to just fit in and live your life how you are supposed to, completely indifferent. But the pain that you will face by watching all of the attrocities happening around the world, is knowledge worth the pain that you would face? How much longer are we going to just roll over and let cops slaughter people in the streets? How much longer are we just going to let these massive companies bend us over and rape us of the profit that we make them. Think about what the role of a laborer in modern societies lineage is. The answer is slavery, labor is with out a doubt a clear evolution of slavery. Why should your boss who sits on his ass all day checking his email make money off of the tangable goods that you produce, or the items that you sell, or the things that you create. In what ass backwards world monet give 99% of his profits to a guy who watched him paint all day. This is that reality. And how much longer will we let these people run our government. How is weed illegal and tobacco products are available at every gas station in 20 different brands and 4 different forms. Its because those captains of industry we were all taught to admire wanted this. They wanted a society where they can influence every vote, every law that is passed, every idea that is proliferated on the internet. Who knows, maybe I am just an amalgamation of all of the angsty advertisements that various liberal thinktanks ran in the late 2010's. But this is the truth, society is rotting, and a pyramid can not stand without its bottom layer. Do not yield.
